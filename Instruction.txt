Here, four different simulators are used with different configurations. Here, all the modules are shared in the Jupyter Notebook files. In order to replicate the simulation to generate different results, a configurations are required with the given explanation in our research articles.

Also, we will release some example configurations very soon. 

LLM Simulator 1 used the RecAgent agent.
LLM Simulator 2 used the Agent4Rec agent.

RL Simulator 1 used the KuaiSim environment with the TD3 agent.
RL Simulator 2 used the RecSim environment with an ε-greedy agent.

Again, three different datasets are shared with an extra dataset.

Dataset 1 is constructed from Movielens-1M.
Dataset 2 is constructed from Last.fm.
Dataset 3 is constructed from Amazon Book.
Extra Dataset is constructed from Book-Crossing.
