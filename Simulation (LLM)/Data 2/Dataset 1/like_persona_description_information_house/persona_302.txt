TASTE: Eclectic mix of animated and foreign films  
REASON: I enjoy the artistry and storytelling in animated features like "Princess Mononoke" and appreciate the cultural depth found in foreign films like "Buena Vista Social Club" and "Kundun."

TASTE: Appreciation for thought-provoking dramas and comedies  
REASON: I gravitate towards films that challenge perspectives, such as "American History X" and "The Dinner Game," while also enjoying lighter, humorous takes on life like "Spy Hard" and "Scrooged."
