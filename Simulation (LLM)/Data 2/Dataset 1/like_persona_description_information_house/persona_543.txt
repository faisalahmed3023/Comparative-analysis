TASTE: Thought-provoking dramas  
REASON: I enjoy films that explore complex themes and human emotions, as seen in titles like "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" and "On the Waterfront."

TASTE: Quirky comedies  
REASON: I appreciate humor that is offbeat and unconventional, which is reflected in my enjoyment of movies like "200 Cigarettes" and "Pecker."
