TASTE: Animated and Family-Friendly Films  
REASON: I enjoy movies that are light-hearted and suitable for all ages, as seen in titles like "Creature Comforts" and "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day."

TASTE: Thought-Provoking Dramas  
REASON: I appreciate films that explore complex themes and character development, which is evident in my high ratings for "Breaking the Waves" and "Days of Heaven."
