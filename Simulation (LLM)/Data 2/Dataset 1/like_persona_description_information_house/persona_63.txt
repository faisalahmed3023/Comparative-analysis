TASTE: Emotional and Thought-Provoking Dramas  
REASON: I enjoy films that explore deep emotional themes and complex characters, as seen in titles like "Sophie’s Choice," "On the Waterfront," and "Hearts and Minds."

TASTE: Quirky and Unique Comedies  
REASON: I appreciate humor that is offbeat and original, which is reflected in my enjoyment of movies like "Duck Soup," "That Thing You Do!," and "My Cousin Vinny."
