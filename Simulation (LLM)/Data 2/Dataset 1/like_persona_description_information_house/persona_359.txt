TASTE: Emotional and Thought-Provoking Dramas  
REASON: I enjoy films that explore deep emotional themes and complex human relationships, as seen in titles like "Man Facing Southeast" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?".

TASTE: Whimsical and Unique Comedies  
REASON: I appreciate films that blend humor with originality, such as "Palookaville" and "Shall We Dance?", which offer a fresh take on comedic storytelling.
