TASTE: Dark Comedy and Satirical Films  
REASON: I enjoy movies that blend humor with serious themes, often using satire to critique society, as seen in titles like "Dr. Strangelove" and "Paths of Glory."

TASTE: Thought-Provoking Dramas  
REASON: I appreciate films that explore complex human emotions and moral dilemmas, which is evident in my high ratings for "Breaking the Waves" and "To Kill a Mockingbird."
