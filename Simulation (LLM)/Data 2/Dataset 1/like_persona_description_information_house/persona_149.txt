TASTE: Dark Comedy Enthusiast  
REASON: I enjoy films that blend humor with darker themes, as seen in titles like "Heathers" and "South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut."

TASTE: Absurdist and Satirical Film Lover  
REASON: I appreciate movies that use absurdity and satire to critique society, which is evident in "American Movie" and "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead."
