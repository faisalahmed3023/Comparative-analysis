TASTE: Emotional and Heartfelt Dramas  
REASON: I enjoy films that explore deep emotional themes and character development, as seen in titles like "Cinema Paradiso," "Good Will Hunting," and "Awakenings."

TASTE: Whimsical and Thought-Provoking Comedies  
REASON: I appreciate movies that blend humor with insightful commentary, such as "Some Like It Hot," "Driving Miss Daisy," and "My Life as a Dog."
