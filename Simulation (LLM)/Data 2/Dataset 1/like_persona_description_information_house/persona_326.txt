TASTE: Romantic Comedies  
REASON: I enjoy light-hearted films that blend humor with love stories, as seen in titles like Pretty Woman and Pretty in Pink.

TASTE: Dramatic Romance  
REASON: I appreciate films that explore deep emotional connections and relationships, which is evident in my enjoyment of Titanic.
