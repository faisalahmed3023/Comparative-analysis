REASON: I enjoy films that explore deep emotional themes and complex character relationships, as seen in titles like "Terms of Endearment" and "Children of Paradise."

TASTE: Quirky comedies with unique storytelling  
REASON: I appreciate humor that is offbeat and original, which is reflected in my enjoyment of movies like "Waiting for Guffman" and "Blazing Saddles."
