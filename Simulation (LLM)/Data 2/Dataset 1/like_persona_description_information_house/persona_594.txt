TASTE: Thought-provoking dramas with existential themes  
REASON: I enjoy films that explore deep philosophical questions and human experiences, as seen in titles like "The Seventh Seal" and "All About My Mother."

TASTE: Quirky and unconventional storytelling  
REASON: I appreciate movies that offer unique narratives and offbeat characters, which is evident in my enjoyment of "Harold and Maude" and "Kicking and Screaming."
